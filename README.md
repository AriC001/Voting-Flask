# Voting Flask
Is a little project for testing and learning flask, the main goal is to keep track of people votes over their favourite team,
It uses firebase for the Register and Login and it keeps track if an user has already voted so it won't let it vote again.
It uses WebSocket to automatically update the score without refreshing the website.

Sadly the deployment was made with Railway but it didn't work well so I shut it down, but to test it, you need python3, and install with pip `pyrebase`  `flask_socketio`
